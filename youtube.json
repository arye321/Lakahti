        "description": "Please  subscribe to 【李子柒 Liziqi 】Liziqi Channel on YouTube if you like my videos: https://goo.gl/nkjpSx\n #李子柒#Liziqi#ChineseCuisine #ChineseFood\n\n小时候我爷爷教过一句让我很疑惑的顺口溜：“红薯芋头本姓张，煮的没有烧的香”…虽然到现在也想不明白为啥一定要姓“张”但一点也不妨碍我爱吃它！年初在前院大门口种了几排毛芋儿后门那多种了香芋，刚好也到了能下嘴的季节。芋儿鸡、烤芋儿、红糖芋圆蛋…你们呢？最喜欢怎么吃芋头啊？\nWhen I was little, grandpa taught me a rather puzzling jingle: “Sweet potato and taro are surnamed Zhang, better roasted than boiled for long.” Even today I still haven’t figured out why on earth they had anything to do with the surname Zhang, but I love them anyway! At the beginning of the year, several rows of taro were planted at the gate of the front yard, and water yam at the back door. Now it’s just the time to feast on them. Taro with chicken stew, roasted taro, eggs with taro balls in brown sugar…And you?

At the beginning of the year, several rows of taro were planted at the gate of the front yard, and water yam at the back door. Now it’s just the time to feast on them.

Thank you! 🥰\n\nFor the first time I measured the time It took me to animate this video.\nI was curious, because I quickly underestimate the sense of time.\nSo this one took me 75 hours (without audio). 😲\nIt took me 62 hours to beat Dark Souls 1\nand 86,2 hours to beat The Witcher 3.\n\nThanks for reading, have a nice day! 😁✌️",

Keep up the great work!\n👑 Play Among Us: http://www.innersloth.com/\n\nDon't reupload! 🚨 Thanks! 🥰\n\nActually 359 Players (in the cafeteria). 🤥\nThe idea was to add 1001 players this time, \nbut then you wouldn't have been able to read \nthe usernames of the individual players. \nSince this was more important to me, \nI changed the amount of players. \n\nAlmost all usernames are your submissions! Thank you! 🥰\n\nFor the first time I measured the time It took me to animate this video.\nI was curious, because I quickly underestimate the sense of time.\nSo this one took me 75 hours (without audio). 😲\nIt took me 62 hours to beat Dark Souls 1\nand 86,2 hours to beat The Witcher 3.\n\nThanks for reading, have a nice day! 😁✌️"
